<p> My name is Sandra Cabanas and I am 21 years old. I was born in Mexico the Federal District and I can speak both English and Spanish. I am able to speak Spanish with my parents and English with my siblings. I am the oldest daugther and I have two younger siblings. I enjoy watching movies or series. The genres that I find very interesting are action, thriller, and family. I like taking picture of arrangements like flower arrangement or lights decoration.
